# ArguMind-AI
Design and implement an Adversarial AI Debate System using an agentic framework. The
system should consist of multiple AI agents, each with specific roles, goals, and capabilities,
working together to conduct structured debates on given topics. The agents should
demonstrate autonomous behavior, adaptability, and goal-oriented decision-making
throughout the debate process.
